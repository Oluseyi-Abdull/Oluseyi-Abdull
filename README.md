# Hi, I’m Oluseyi Abdull
- I am a recently Graduated Robotics Engineering Student, I am looking to get involed in as many interesting projects as possible, my knowledge and understanding is mostly within Python and Simplified C for Micro-controllers for Embedded Systems Design
  for physical projects that interact with the world. I enjoy employing complex coding techniques within these projects that draw inpiration for a multitude of disciplines to make a project as effective as possible.
  
- 📚 I’m interested in may different areas includiing but not limited to Robotics, BioEngineering, Neuroscience
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Data Engineering Artificial Intelligence and some of its subtopics
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can deepen my knowledge in any of the fields of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, BioEngineering, Computational Biology.
  
- 📫 I am easiest to reach on though my email address oluseyi.abdull@gmail.com , or via my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/feed/
